// read the docs!!!  some useful methods to look into ---> .parent() .attr() .siblings() .each() .addClass() .removeClass(), and of course .val()

// you CAN NOT use es6 arrow functions as arguments in jquery methods and have 'this' work correctly ---> not () => {}. instead you must use --> function () {}

// look into vanilla JS method .split()
    // an example of .split() would be -->

        let string = "Journey_to-Space";
        let splitString = string.split("_");

    // the log of splitString would be

        ["Journey", "to-Space"];
        let splitString2 = string.split('-');

    // log of splitString2 would be

        ['Journey_to', 'Space'];

// how can you use this??
// try playing around with chaining!

//the two main functions to write (aside from the event listener) will need to be invoked.
