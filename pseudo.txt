// you CAN NOT use es6 arrow functions as arguments in jquery methods and have 'this' work correctly ---> not () => {}. instead you must use --> function () {}

// look into vanilla JS method .split()
    // an example of .split() would be -->

        let string = "Journey_to-Space"; 
        let splitString = string.split("_");

    // the log of splitString would be

        ["Journey", "to-Space"];
        let splitString2 = string.split('-');

    // log of splitString2 would be

        ['Journey_to', 'Space'];
