## Description
 
This is challenge 5 of the bootcamp. I took given HTML and CSS code and created the JavaScript portion of the website to make it work. The password generator a website where a user can go to generate a password with the criteria they like. When the user visits the webpage, they are shown a box with a "generate" button at the bottom of it. When clicked, the button brings up a prompt, asking the user to input the desired length of their new password (8-128). Once that is chosen, they are taken through a set of confirms that ask if they would like upper and lowercase letters, special characters, and numbers. Once they have chosen the desired criteria, their new password generates in the box. Through JavaScript, I added commentary explaining every step of the way. There is also a scriptP which was my note taking area featuring some steps taken to reach the desired function.
